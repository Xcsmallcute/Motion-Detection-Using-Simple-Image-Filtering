# Motion-Detection-Using-Simple-Image-Filtering
## Introduction
Detection of moving object in an image sequences is very important
to video, because it is the first relevant step of information extraction
in many computer vision applications. Motion detection in this project is 
setted with a stationary camera where most of the pixels belong to a unchanged
background. In this case, the intensity values observed at a pixel over time are
nearly constants or slowly varing signals, except when a moving object is passing
through that piexl, in that case, the intensity of background is replaces by the 
intensity of foreground. Thus, we can detect a moving object by looking at large 
gradients in the temporal evolution of the pixel values.
